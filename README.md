# HL-Editor
Map Editor for the game History Line 1914-1918 by Blue Byte (Released as The Great War: 1914-1918 in the US)
written in C++/Qt 

Originally I had also planned to add a simpler version of the editor for DOS as well, so that this old game can also be edited in its natural environment.
But for lack of time the additional DOS version got stuck in its infancy and so far only allows the viewing of history line map files.

This project required some reverse engineering effort to figure out the structure of the game files and ressources.
I have saved the findings as an article in the modding wiki:
