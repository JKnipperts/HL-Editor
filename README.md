# HL-Editor
Map Editor for the game History Line 1914-1918 by Blue Byte (Released as The Great War: 1914-1918 in the US)

Still under development. Many functions are still missing or not finished yet.

This project required some reverse engineering effort to figure out the structure of the game files.
I have collected the results here:
